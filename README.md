# Call for participation in 2019

I am making a personal goal of 20 rejections for submitting talks to open call for proposals for 2019. Why rejections and not something more positive like, "I will talk at _n_ of conferences next year." My goal is the process and participation moving forward and learning, to improve and better articulate my thoughts and ideas. If I went with a goal simliar to the one just stated, each rejection would feel like a set back, even knowing full well that everyone gets rejectioned for talks. I want to embrace, and treat rejects as a positive, and while it doesn't always feel that way, it absolutely is.
