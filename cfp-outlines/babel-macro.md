Babel plugins are a powerful tool we use daily to transform and modify our code helping us create great projects faster.They can take entire mundane and repetitive code blocks and abstract them away, making the process faster and more enjoyble. But once we've made a plugin, if we've gotten that far, the set-up then config can be daunting. Enter Babel-plugin-macros. This allows us to do project wide code transforms will all the benefits of a plugin, but with zero config. And we all love zero config.

## Details for committee

_If you have more information that may be relevant to our decision, please include it here. You may want to elaborate on things such as: Does your talk include a demo? Why should someone care about this talk? If part of the extended ecosystem, how does it relate to React?_
Babel-plugin-macros is now included with Create React App 2.0, and with it opens a world of possibilities without having to eject the app if something is not baked in.

## Pitch

_Explain why you're the right person to present this talk. Why should the audience care about this talk? Why are you excited about it? Only the selection committee will see this. If you're a new speaker, help us know you'll perform well on stage._
Getting into the abstract syntax tree(AST) is a lot of fun, but is hard to translate a topic like that into something really exciting. Babel macros is an opportunity show the power of using the AST with a direct tangible goal of making something awesome in your project or for your team to use.
