# Elm + Markdown = â™¥

Markdown is great for so many things, wouldn't it be great to have the ability to parse markdown directly with Elm? Making use of elm/parser to do a lot of the heavy lifting for us, we can make writing and rending markdown in Elm and joyful as writing Elm itself!

- inspired by (Tereza's talk: Demystifying Parsers)[https://2018.elm-conf.us/schedule/tereza-sokol] from Elm conf solving her need for yaml parsing with Elm
- wanting to contribute to the Elm community and ecosystem in a useful way. Markdown parsing is listed in the (Elm Project Contribution Guide)[https://github.com/elm/projects#markdown-parser]
- A bit of conference driven development. Even if I don't quite manage to get markdown successfully parsing, sharing my attempts and failures can only help others learn from it and achieve what they set out to do.

Markdown is such an integral part of our lives as developers, so much of our communication / documentation written out in this format. Having a tool, the ability to parse markdown using the power tools elm gives us through the simple interface of the elm/parser can open so many possibilities between two things we spend so much time reading / writing / editing, Elm and Markdown.
