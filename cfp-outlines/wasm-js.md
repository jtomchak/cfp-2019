Web Assembly Needs Your Help!

## Summary (600 characters)

Web Assembly has the potential to really shape the next generation of web applications and more. We've seen the speed tests and examples of its raw power. Headlines often read, "Web Assembly is Here, JavaScript is dead!" I want to show two possible futures. In the one hand, the JavaScript community embraces WASM, takes it under its wing, builds tooling, documentation, vibrant libraries, mountains of examples and the entire ecosystem flourishes. In the other, WASM is kept at arm's length, compiled in the corner by out of touch developers, only used in the direst of performance cases.
Illustrating these two timelines, I hope, will excite and encourage developers across the spectrum to embrace WASM, help it move forward, get involved, not at the demise of JavaScript, but side by side carrying JavaScript, the web platform, and more to another level of possibilities.
